# Golang Hexa

Golang project boilerplate with hexagonal (domain-driven, onion) code architecture.

Showcases simple TODO list app. The app is runable, but not really functional (database is not working) and resolvers in GQL API are not implemnted.

Includes:
- Core services and repos (todo and todo list)
- Logger, app config
- Mail Service
- GQL server (using gqlgen)
- Mongo client

Its just example of possible usage of known technologies, but you can put there wathever you need :)
